# HTTPS Backend Setup Complete! üîí

## ‚úÖ Successfully Fixed Mixed Content Errors

The EconLens backend has been successfully upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS using Nginx reverse proxy and self-signed SSL certificate to resolve mixed content errors when the frontend is served over HTTPS via CloudFront.

## üõ†Ô∏è What Was Implemented

### 1. Nginx Reverse Proxy Installation
- **Installed**: Nginx 1.28.0 on Amazon Linux 2023
- **Configuration**: Reverse proxy forwarding requests to Node.js backend on port 3001
- **Status**: Active and enabled as systemd service

### 2. SSL Certificate Setup
- **Type**: Self-signed SSL certificate (365 days validity)
- **Subject**: `/C=US/ST=Virginia/L=Richmond/O=EconLens/OU=Development/CN=44.203.253.29`
- **Location**: 
  - Certificate: `/etc/ssl/certs/econlens.crt`
  - Private Key: `/etc/ssl/private/econlens.key` (600 permissions)

### 3. HTTPS Configuration
- **HTTPS Port**: 443 (SSL termination at Nginx)
- **HTTP Redirect**: All HTTP requests automatically redirect to HTTPS
- **Security Headers**: Modern SSL/TLS configuration with security headers
- **Backend Connection**: Nginx proxies to Node.js backend on localhost:3001

### 4. Security Features
- **SSL Protocols**: TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3
- **Security Headers**:
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Referrer-Policy
- **Modern Cipher Suites**: ECDHE-RSA-AES with GCM and SHA

## üåê Endpoints Now Available

| Endpoint | URL | Status |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Health Check | `https://44.203.253.29/health` | ‚úÖ Working |
| API Base | `https://44.203.253.29/api/*` | ‚úÖ Working (requires auth) |
| HTTP Redirect | `http://44.203.253.29/*` | ‚úÖ Redirects to HTTPS |

## üìù Frontend Configuration Updated

### Constants Updated (`frontend/src/utils/constants.ts`)
```typescript
// OLD: export const API_BASE_URL = 'http://44.203.253.29:3001';
export const API_BASE_URL = 'https://44.203.253.29';
```

### Documentation Updated
- ‚úÖ Frontend README.md
- ‚úÖ API Test page display
- ‚úÖ Layout component footer
- ‚úÖ CORS configuration documentation
- ‚úÖ Deployment guides

## üß™ Verification Results

### HTTPS Endpoint Test
```bash
$ curl -k https://44.203.253.29/health
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-19T00:22:40.274Z",
  "service": "econlens-backend",
  "environment": "development"
}
```

### HTTP to HTTPS Redirect Test
```bash
$ curl -I http://44.203.253.29/health
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://44.203.253.29/health
```

### API Authentication Test
```bash
$ curl -k https://44.203.253.29/api/portfolios
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Authentication required",
  "message": "No token provided"
}
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Nginx Configuration (`/etc/nginx/conf.d/econlens.conf`)
- HTTP server (port 80): Redirects all traffic to HTTPS
- HTTPS server (port 443): SSL termination + reverse proxy
- Proxy headers: Properly forwards client information to backend
- Timeouts and buffering: Optimized for API performance

### SSL Certificate Details
- **Algorithm**: RSA 2048-bit
- **Validity**: 365 days from creation
- **Purpose**: Development/testing (self-signed)
- **Browser Warning**: Expected due to self-signed nature

### Service Management
- **Nginx**: `systemctl status nginx` - Active and enabled
- **Backend**: PM2 managed Node.js process on port 3001
- **Auto-start**: Both services configured to start on boot

## üöÄ Benefits Achieved

### 1. Mixed Content Resolution
- ‚úÖ CloudFront HTTPS frontend can now make HTTPS API calls
- ‚úÖ No more browser security warnings about mixed HTTP/HTTPS content
- ‚úÖ Proper SSL/TLS encryption for all API communications

### 2. Enhanced Security
- ‚úÖ All traffic encrypted between frontend and backend
- ‚úÖ Modern security headers protecting against common attacks
- ‚úÖ Secure cookie and credential handling

### 3. Production Readiness
- ‚úÖ SSL termination at reverse proxy layer
- ‚úÖ Backend protected behind proxy (not directly exposed)
- ‚úÖ Proper request forwarding with client information
- ‚úÖ Health check monitoring capabilities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Self-Signed Certificate Warning
- **Browser Warning**: Users will see "Your connection is not private" warnings
- **Development Use**: Acceptable for development/testing environments
- **Production Recommendation**: Use proper domain name + Let's Encrypt certificate

### Security Group Configuration
- **Port 443**: Already open for HTTPS traffic
- **Port 80**: Available for HTTP redirect
- **Port 3001**: Backend protected (only accessible via localhost)

## üîÑ Next Steps for Production

1. **Domain Name**: Set up proper domain name (e.g., `api.econlens.com`)
2. **Let's Encrypt**: Replace self-signed certificate with trusted CA certificate
3. **Load Balancer**: Consider using AWS Application Load Balancer for SSL termination
4. **Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch monitoring for Nginx and SSL certificate expiration
5. **Backup**: Implement automated certificate renewal

## üéØ Frontend Development Ready

Your React frontend can now:
- ‚úÖ Make secure HTTPS API calls to `https://44.203.253.29`
- ‚úÖ Avoid mixed content warnings in production
- ‚úÖ Use proper authentication with JWT tokens over HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Deploy to CloudFront without SSL/TLS compatibility issues

## üîç Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check Nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Check SSL certificate
openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/econlens.crt -text -noout

# Test HTTPS endpoint
curl -k -I https://44.203.253.29/health

# View Nginx access logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

# View Nginx error logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

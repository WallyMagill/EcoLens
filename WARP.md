## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Stage Development Approach
EcoLens follows a 4-stage development progression from traditional AWS services to full serverless:

1. **Stage 1 (Foundation) - âœ… COMPLETED**: VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, Cognito - Traditional AWS architecture
2. **Stage 2 (Serverless Migration) - ðŸ”„ NEXT**: API Gateway + Lambda, file processing
3. **Stage 3 (AI Integration) - ðŸ“‹ PLANNED**: AWS Bedrock, SQS, ElastiCache for AI scenarios
4. **Stage 4 (Production Ready) - ðŸ“‹ PLANNED**: Full CDK automation, CI/CD, monitoring

### Core Data Architecture
- **Portfolio Assets**: Support for stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, bonds, REITs, commodities
- **Economic Scenarios**: 5 predefined scenarios (recession, inflation, growth, etc.)
- **AI Analysis**: AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for scenario impact analysis
- **User Authentication**: AWS Cognito with JWT tokens
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with well-defined schema for portfolios and analysis

### Key Services Integration

**Current Implementation (Stage 1):**
- **Frontend**: React TypeScript with Vite, deployed to S3 static website hosting
- **API Layer**: Express.js on EC2 with Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on RDS with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito User Pool with JWT tokens
- **File Storage**: S3 for static assets and future CSV uploads
- **Infrastructure**: CDK for Infrastructure as Code

**Future Implementation (Stages 2-4):**
- **API Layer**: Express.js on Lambda with API Gateway
- **AI Processing**: AWS Bedrock for economic scenario analysis
- **File Processing**: Lambda for CSV processing
- **Caching**: ElastiCache for performance optimization
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for logs and metrics
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipelines

### Security & Compliance
- VPC with proper subnet segregation (public/private)
- Security groups with least privilege access
- IAM roles with minimal permissions
- JWT-based authentication
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Development Guidelines

### AI Tool Usage Strategy
This project is designed for AI-assisted development:

- **Claude**: Architecture decisions, complex problem solving, code review
- **Cursor**: File creation, code generation, refactoring
- **GitHub Copilot**: Auto-completion, pattern recognition
- **Warp**: Terminal operations, AWS CLI commands

### Code Organization
**Monorepo Structure**: EcoLens uses npm workspaces for dependency management across packages.

- `infrastructure/`: CDK stacks with AWS infrastructure as code
- `backend/`: Express.js API with modular route/service/middleware structure
- `frontend/`: React TypeScript application with Redux Toolkit
- `shared/`: Common types, interfaces, and utilities used across packages
- `docs/`: Comprehensive stage-by-stage implementation guides
- `scripts/`: Deployment and utility scripts
- `package.json`: Root workspace configuration with cross-package commands

### Environment Management
- Development: Uses AWS free tier resources where possible
- Staging: Scaled-down production environment
- Production: Full monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components and functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Infrastructure tests using CDK unit testing framework

### Data Import/Export
- CSV import for portfolio data with validation
- Standard format with required columns: Symbol, Name, Asset Type, Allocation %, Dollar Amount
- Extended format supports additional metadata like expense ratios, dividend yields

## Documentation Structure

The `docs/` directory contains comprehensive implementation guides:
- Core architecture and technical stack documentation
- Stage-by-stage development plans with AI tool optimization
- Detailed API design and data model specifications
- Production deployment and operations guides
- Testing, quality assurance, and launch checklists

Each document includes AI tool integration strategies and specific prompts for optimal development workflow.

## Cost Optimization

Project designed to maximize AWS free tier usage:
- Stage 1: ~$0.50/month (within free tier)
- Stage 2: ~$0.50/month (serverless efficiency)
- Stage 3: ~$25/month (AI services added)
- Stage 4: ~$95/month (production features)

## Quick Start References

1. **First Time Setup**: Start with `docs/Stage-0-Pre-Setup-Phase.md`
2. **Architecture Overview**: Review `docs/02-AWS-Architecture-and-Technical-Stack.md`
3. **Data Models**: Reference `docs/Portfolio-Data-Specification.md`
4. **AI Tool Optimization**: Use `docs/AI-Tools-Optimization-Guide.md` for development workflow

## AWS Profile Configuration

Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the correct profile:
```bash
aws configure --profile econlens-admin
# AWS Access Key ID: [your-access-key]
# AWS Secret Access Key: [your-secret-key]
# Default region name: us-east-1
# Default output format: json
```

Set environment variable for CDK:
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=econlens-admin
```

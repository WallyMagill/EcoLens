# EconLens Stage-by-Stage Development Plan

## Development Philosophy and Approach

> **Important Code Disclaimer**: All code examples throughout the EconLens documentation are architectural references and implementation guides. They demonstrate patterns, structures, and best practices but are NOT production-ready code. Use AI tools (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Warp) to generate, analyze, refine, and implement actual production code based on these specifications.

This 8-week development plan progresses from AWS fundamentals to production-ready architecture while delivering functional user value at each stage. Each stage builds upon previous work while introducing new AWS services and architectural patterns, ensuring comprehensive cloud skills development.

**Detailed Stage Documentation**: Each stage now has a comprehensive dedicated document with daily tasks, AI tool usage strategies, and detailed implementation guidance.

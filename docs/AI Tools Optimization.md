## Claude (Anthropic) - Strategic AI Assistant

### **Best Use Cases:**
- **Architecture Decision Making**: "Should I use RDS or DynamoDB for portfolio storage?"
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Debugging multi-service integration issues
- **Code Review & Analysis**: Upload entire files for comprehensive review
- **Documentation Generation**: API docs, README files, technical specifications
- **Planning & Strategy**: Breaking down complex features into implementation steps

### **Optimal Prompting Strategies:**
```
CONTEXT: I'm building EconLens, a portfolio analysis tool using AWS serverless architecture.

TASK: [Specific request]

CONSTRAINTS: 
- Using TypeScript/Node.js 20
- AWS CDK for infrastructure
- React 18+ frontend with TypeScript
- Must stay within AWS free tier initially

CURRENT STATUS: [What you've built so far]

SPECIFIC QUESTION: [Exact problem you need solved]
```

### **When to Use Claude:**
- ✅ Complex architectural decisions
- ✅ Multi-file code analysis
- ✅ Error debugging when you're stuck
- ✅ Planning implementation approach
- ✅ Code optimization suggestions
- ❌ Simple auto-completion
- ❌ Boilerplate code generation (use Cursor instead)

## Cursor - AI Code Editor

### **Best Use Cases:**
- **File Creation**: New components, Lambda functions, database schemas
- **Code Generation**: Complete functions based on specifications
- **Refactoring**: Updating patterns across multiple files
- **Context-Aware Development**: Understanding your codebase structure
- **Integration Implementation**: Connecting different services/APIs

### **Optimal Workflow:**
1. **Start with Specifications**: Paste relevant docs section into Cursor
2. **Generate Initial Code**: Use Ctrl+K with specific prompts
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Use chat to modify and improve
4. **Multi-file Coordination**: Let Cursor understand file relationships

### **Cursor Prompting Best Practices:**
```
// For new Lambda function
Create a Lambda function that:
- Handles portfolio creation from API Gateway
- Validates portfolio data using the schema from types/portfolio.ts
- Stores in PostgreSQL using the connection from utils/database.ts
- Returns standardized response format
- Includes proper error handling and logging
```

### **When to Use Cursor:**
- ✅ Writing new files/functions
- ✅ Implementing specific features
- ✅ Refactoring existing code
- ✅ Understanding codebase context
- ❌ High-level architecture decisions
- ❌ Complex debugging (use Claude for analysis first)

## Warp - AI-Enhanced Terminal

### **Best Use Cases:**
- **AWS CLI Operations**: Complex AWS commands with explanation
- **Environment Setup**: Package installation, configuration
- **Deployment Commands**: CDK deploy, npm scripts, Docker operations
- **Git Operations**: Complex git workflows, branch management
- **Debugging Commands**: Log analysis, service status checks

### **Optimal Workflow:**
1. **Use AI Command Search**: Ask Warp AI for specific commands
2. **Command Explanation**: Understand what commands do before running
3. **Error Resolution**: Paste errors into Warp AI for solutions
4. **Workflow Automation**: Create aliases and scripts

### **Example Warp AI Queries:**
```
"Deploy my CDK stack to dev environment with specific context"
"Set up AWS CLI with named profiles for multiple environments"
"Install all dependencies for a TypeScript React project"
"Debug why my Lambda function isn't connecting to RDS"
```

### **When to Use Warp:**
- ✅ Command line operations
- ✅ AWS CLI tasks
- ✅ Environment troubleshooting
- ✅ Deployment automation
- ❌ Code generation (use Cursor)
- ❌ Architecture planning (use Claude)

## GitHub Copilot - Code Completion

### **Best Use Cases:**
- **Auto-completion**: Function parameters, variable names
- **Pattern Recognition**: Similar code patterns in your project
- **Quick Implementations**: Standard algorithms, utility functions
- **Test Generation**: Unit tests based on existing functions
- **Comment-to-Code**: Writing code from descriptive comments

### **Optimization Tips:**
1. **Write Descriptive Comments**: Copilot generates better code from good comments
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent patterns for better suggestions
3. **Context Files**: Keep relevant files open for better context
4. **Accept Partially**: Take what's good, modify what's not

### **Example Usage Pattern:**
```typescript
// Create a function that validates portfolio allocation percentages sum to 100
// and returns detailed validation results with specific error messages
function validatePortfolioAllocation(assets: Asset[]): ValidationResult {
  // Copilot will suggest the implementation based on this comment
}
```

### **When to Use GitHub Copilot:**
- ✅ Code completion during active development
- ✅ Quick utility function generation
- ✅ Test case generation
- ✅ Standard pattern implementation
- ❌ Complex business logic (use Cursor + Claude)
- ❌ Architecture decisions (use Claude)

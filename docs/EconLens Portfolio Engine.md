## Portfolio Calculation Methodology

### Impact Calculation Process

#### Step 1: Asset Classification and Weighting
For each portfolio asset, the system determines its primary classification and applies the appropriate scenario impact factors. The calculation considers both the direct impact on the asset class and any secondary effects based on asset-specific characteristics such as sector, geographic region, and credit quality.

**Base Impact Calculation:**
1. Identify the asset's primary category (domestic_equity, government_bonds, etc.)
2. Apply the scenario impact range based on asset allocation percentage
3. Adjust for asset-specific factors (sector, geography, credit rating)
4. Calculate weighted impact contribution to overall portfolio

#### Step 2: Correlation Adjustments
During stress scenarios, asset correlations typically increase, reducing diversification benefits. The system applies dynamic correlation adjustments based on:
- Historical correlation patterns during similar scenarios
- Asset class relationship changes under stress
- Portfolio concentration and diversification metrics
- Time horizon considerations for correlation mean reversion

#### Step 3: Portfolio-Level Calculations
The final portfolio impact considers:
- **Weighted Average Impact**: Sum of individual asset impacts weighted by allocation
- **Diversification Benefit/Penalty**: Adjustment based on correlation changes
- **Concentration Risk**: Additional impact for under-diversified portfolios
- **Rebalancing Opportunities**: Potential benefits from tactical rebalancing
- **Liquidity Considerations**: Impact of potential liquidity constraints

#### Step 4: Confidence Score Generation
Each calculation includes a confidence score (0-100) based on:
- Historical precedent strength (40% weight)
- Portfolio similarity to historical examples (30% weight)
- Scenario parameter certainty (20% weight)
- Model validation results (10% weight)

            moderate: "0.2-0.4 (moderately concentrated)", 
            high: ">0.4 (concentrated)"
        }
    },

            low: "<70% domestic allocation",
            moderate: "70-85% domestic allocation", 
            high: ">85% domestic allocation"
        }
    },

        calculation: "Weighted average credit quality",
        assessment: "Based on bond holdings and corporate bond exposure"
    },
    liquidityRisk: {
        calculation: "Percentage in illiquid assets",
        thresholds: {
            low: "<10% illiquid assets",
            moderate: "10-25% illiquid assets",
            high: ">25% illiquid assets"
        }

The portfolio engine validates its calculations against historical scenarios to ensure accuracy and calibrate confidence scores:

1. **2008-2009 Financial Crisis**: Test recession scenario against actual portfolio performance
2. **2020 COVID Crash**: Validate market crash scenario calculations  
3. **2021-2022 Inflation**: Compare inflation scenario against real asset performance
4. **Rate Hike Cycles**: Test interest rate shock against historical bond performance

#### Benchmark Comparisons
- **Index Performance**: Compare calculated impacts against major index performance during historical scenarios
- **Sector Analysis**: Validate sector-specific impacts against sector ETF performance
- **Asset Class Validation**: Cross-check asset class impacts against historical data
